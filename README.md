# Code of the Python workshop (31 July 2019)
This repository contains the notebooks of the 5 sections covered during the workshop which have been sourced from multiple books. 

This repository is read-only. The notebooks can be opened using Google Colab. 

## Running the code in the cloud

With [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), the notebooks can be run directly from your web browser without installing anything. 

Do take note if the Colab notebook is left unattended for 90 minutes, the instance is automatically terminated. For more information on Google Colab, here's the link to the [FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html). 

## Running the code using Jupyter Notebook on your local machine

1. [Download and install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section): choose the **Python 3.7, 64-bit** version for your operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows).

2. Open a terminal (```cmd``` on Windows).

3. Clone the repository:

```$ git clone https://github.com/atlas-github/20190731SMG.git```

```$ cd 20190731SMG```

4. Launch the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html):
